## Docker challenge

The challenge consists of creating an application consisting of an API, a database and a front-end application, all runing in containers in the same network. The containers must communicate successfully. 

The application itself can be as simples as possible since the discipline focuses on docker and containers.

It is also required to look for vulnerabilities in the application. The ideia is to be aware that applications can be born in day one with vulnerabilities, container-related or not, and to become familiar with how one can mitigate them.
